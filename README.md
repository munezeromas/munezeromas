# 👋 Hi, I’m @munezeromas

- 👀 I’m interested in building creative, impactful tech solutions that solve real problems in education, agriculture, and the environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Java**, **Object-Oriented Programming**, **AI/ML**, and **Web Development (HTML, CSS, JS)**.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that empower youth, promote sustainability (like Sukura 🌍), or use tech for social good.
